# Soccer League Table
Reference implementation of AngularJS + ASP.NET Web API

Startup Projects:
- AngularClient
- WebApi

Highlights: Business logic is centralised in the Domain classes; the methods are entirely without side-effects ("pure" in a functional sense). Therefore business logic is able to be unit-tested without necessitating the use of Dependency Injection and mocking.
